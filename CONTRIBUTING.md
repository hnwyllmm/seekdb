## Code of Conduct

By participating, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Contribution Workflow

**Our workflow differs depending on whether you are fixing a bug or implementing a new feature. We prioritize design and discussion for new features to ensure architectural consistency.**

### Step 1: Start with an Issue
All contributions must be associated with a GitHub Issue.

+ **Search first**: Check if the issue already exists.
+ **Create new**: If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/oceanbase/seekdb/issues).
    - Use `[Bug]` in the title for bugs.
    - Use `[Feature]` in the title for new capabilities.

### Step 2: Bug Fixes and New Features
#### Bug Fixes
For verified bugs, you can proceed directly to coding after the issue is acknowledged.

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Branch** from `develop` (e.g., `fix/issue-123`).
3. **Fix** the bug and add a regression test case.
4. **Submit PR**.

#### New Features (The "Design-First" Rule)
For new features, we strictly enforce a **Design-First** workflow. **Do not submit code PRs for large features without an approved design.**

1. **Discuss**: Share your initial thoughts in the Issue comments. Wait for a maintainer to validate the requirement.
2. **Draft Design**: Write a design document in Markdown.
3. **Submit Design PR**:
    - Place your file in the `docs/design/` directory.
    - Filename convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`.
    - Submit a Pull Request targeting the `develop` branch.
    - **Title**: `[Design] Proposal for <Feature Name>`.
4. **Design Review**: Maintainers will review the architecture, API changes, and compatibility.
5. **Implementation**: Once the Design PR is **merged**, you may start coding.

### Step 3: Setup & Coding
We follow a standard "fork-and-pull" workflow. All development should be based on the develop branch.

1. Fork the [seekdb repository](https://github.com/oceanbase/seekdb) on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-name>/seekdb.git
   cd seekdb
   ```
3. [Configure](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork) your local repo by adding the remote official repo as upstream:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/oceanbase/seekdb.git
   ```
4. Create a Branch Sync with upstream and create a descriptive branch:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout upstream/develop -b fix/issue-123
   ```
   > Naming convention: type/description-issue-number

### Step 4: Build & Test
Before submitting, you must ensure the code builds and passes tests locally.The development guide is located under the [docs](docs/README.md) folder. Please refer to it for detailed build instructions.

**Basic build commands**:

```bash
# Configure the project (Generate build files)
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build for debugging
cmake debug

# Build the project
cmake --build build -- -j$(nproc)

```

* Coverage: Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes, including edge cases.
* Regression: Ensure all local tests pass before submitting.
* Consistency: Follow existing test patterns.

**Run tests**:
```bash
# Run all tests via [CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html):
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure

# Alternatively, for Debug build:
cd build_debug
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Step 5: Submit Pull Request
When you are ready to submit your code:

1. Push your branch to your forked repository.
2. Open a Pull Request against the `develop` branch of `oceanbase/seekdb`.
3. **Link the Issue**: In the PR description, explicitly link the issue (e.g., `Fixes #123`) and the Design PR (if applicable).
4. **Sign the CLA**: You will be prompted to sign the OceanBase Contributor License Agreement (CLA) if you haven't already.

### Step 6: Review & Merge
1. **Code Review**: Community maintainers will review your code. Be prepared to make changes based on feedback.
2. **CI**: Your PR must pass all automated CI checks (Build, Test, Linter).
3. **Merge**: Once approved by maintainers and passing CI, your code will be merged!

>By default, pull requests are merged into the `develop` branch, which is the default branch of [seekdb](https://github.com/oceanbase/seekdb). The maintainers will merge `develop` into `master` branch periodically. If you want to get the latest code, you can pull the `master` branch.


## General Guidelines

Before submitting your pull requests for review, make sure that:

- Your changes are consistent with the project's coding style.
- You have run all relevant tests and they pass.
- Your code is well-documented and commented where necessary.
- You have considered backward compatibility when making changes.
- The maintenance burden of new features is acceptable.

### Best Practices

- **Avoid large pull requests**: Large PRs are much less likely to be merged as they are incredibly hard to review. Split large changes into smaller, focused PRs.
- **Discuss first**: For major changes or new features, discuss your intended changes with the core team on GitHub before starting implementation.
- **Announce your work**: If you're working on an existing issue, announce that you are working on it to avoid duplicate work.
- **Update documentation**: If your changes affect user-facing functionality, update the relevant documentation.

### CI Checks

All pull requests must pass continuous integration (CI) checks before merging. Currently, there are two types of CI checks:

- **Compile**: This check will compile the code on CentOS and Ubuntu to ensure your changes compile successfully on different platforms.
- **Farm**: This check will run the unit tests and some MySQL test cases to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

> **Note**: If the farm check fails and you think it is not related to your changes, you can ask the reviewer to re-run the farm check, or the reviewer will re-run it if needed.


### PR Style Guides

Follow the same guidelines as commit messages. Provide a clear description of:
- What changes were made
- Why the changes were necessary
- How the changes were tested
- Any breaking changes or migration notes
